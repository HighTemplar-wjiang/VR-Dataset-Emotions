# VR-Dataset-Emotions
This repository is for our paper published in TVCG "_An Immersive and Interactive VR Dataset to Elicit Emotions_".

This dataset includes:
- Five VR scenes that can elicit different emotions.
- An example VR app that includes all the five scenes, including an interactive SAM qestionnaire scene.
- [Optional] A server that can record the user's behavior and SAM reports.

## Scene Modeling
Our VR scenes are modeled based on the original validated 360째 video scenes. The modeling process includes:
1. **Scene Selection**: Select the scenes that can elicit the targeted emotions.
1. **Scene Modeling**: Model the scenes in Unity and Blender with the same content and layout as the original 360째 video scenes.
1. **Lighting and Texturing**: Adjust the lighting and texturing to make the scenes more immersive.
1. **Interaction Design**: Enable users to be able to teleport to explore the scenes.

An example comparison between the original 360째 video scene (left) and the modeled VR scene (right) is shown below:

## Targeted Emotions
Our dataset has been validated by 160 participants (80 participants for modeled VR scenes, 80 participants for the original 360째 video scenes). The mean values of the targeted emotions are shown below:

## Environment Requirements
- Unity 2021.3 Long-Term-Support (LTS) version.
- OpenXR plugin for Unity.
- VR headset: the VR app was tested on Oculus Quest 2, you may need to modify the settings for other VR devices.
- [Optional] Python 3 with Django. 

## Quick Start
### Test VR Scenes
1. Download or clone this repository.
1. Load the Unity project in the `unity` folder.
1. For each scene, open the scene file in the `Scenes` folder and press the play button to test the scene.
1. [Optional] Build and deploy the VR app to your VR headset: 
    - Go to `File` -> `Build Settings` -> `Build` to build the app.
    - Follow the instructions to deploy the app to your VR headset.

### [Optional] Remote Server
The remote server is for recording user's behavior and SAM reports in VR using Django. You need to install Django to run the server:
```
pip install numpy django django-cors-headers
```
It is recommended to use a virtual environment such as venv or Anaconda.

#### For quick test, go to the `server` folder and run the server.

You may need to create a superuser to access the admin page:
```bash
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

Then run the server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Then go to `127.0.0.1:8000/admin` in your browser to check the recorded data.

For detailed data recording structure, please refer to the `server/emotion_app/models.py` file. 

### [Optional] Unity Settings for Data Recording
#### Recording SAM Reports
1. Open the `Assets/Scenes/EmotionSurvey` scene.
1. Go to the `SurveySAM` object in the hierarchy.
1. In the `SAM Survey Events` script component, set the `Server URL` to your server URL.
  - For local test, you can set it to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/emotion-survey/`.

#### Recording User's Behavior
1. Open the corresponding scene in the `Assets/Scenes` folder.
1. Go to the `SceneController` object in the hierarchy.
1. In the `Camera Post Sender` script component, set the `Server URL` to your server URL.
  - For local test, you can set it to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/camera-post/`.
  - Alternatively, open the `Scripts/Utility/CameraPostSender.cs` script and modify the `serverURL` variable, this will become the default setting in the Unity editor for all scenes.

#### For actual deployment, follow the instructions in the Django [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/deployment/).
